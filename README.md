  <h2>ðŸš€ What is Design System?</h2>
  
  **It is a set of reusable components, 
  with the objective of standardizing the elements that make up the interface of an application to facilitate its construction,
  maintenance and communication between different teams, such as designers, developers, etc.**
  
  Have you ever wondered what it would be like to work in an application that has several buttons? 
  With teams doing different parts of this application without a foundation to follow? 
  Without a standardization of components or without a pre-defined visual identity. 
  Is this application being developed in the best way?
  
  The Design System allows us, for example, to create one or more button models, 
  with an identity and pattern to be followed, so, when developing, 
  ust follow this pre-defined model. In addition to saving time, it reduces the risk of mistakes, 
  improves communication between different teams and makes the application have a much better visual harmony, among other benefits.

  <h2>ðŸš€ What did I learn from this project? </h2> 
 
  In this project I had my first contact with a Design System, its importance and the effectiveness of its use. 
  I learned to use figma better (creating a component with attributes, using Plugins, applying some css-like concepts like flex design).

  I also had my first contact with Storybook. 
  How we can document application components, how they work, their various forms, how to apply tests via Storybook, 
  and we can see how this component behaves without having to use the application itself.

  Finally, I applied CI/CD concepts with GitHub Actions to automatically deploy the Storybook every time the Master branch content is updated.
